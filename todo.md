# Portfolio Refactor: From Academic to Architect (Money-First)

## Phase 1: Visual & Typographic Polish (The "Tech-Noir" Handshake)

* [ ] **Switch Theme to HugoTeX:** Adopt `kaisugi/HugoTeX` for server-side LaTeX rendering. It signals "Scientific Rigor" instantly.
* [ ] **CSS Aesthetic Tweak:**
* [ ] Set background to `#0a0a0a` (Deep Matte).
* [ ] Accents in `#00ffcc` (Electric Cyan) for "Action" buttons only.
* [ ] Implement a subtle scanline or grid background (opacity: 0.03).
* [ ] **Typography:** Use `JetBrains Mono` for headings and `Inter` or `Satoshi` for body text.

## Phase 2: The "Hidalgo" Checklist (The Technical Moat Posts)

*Goal: Bridge the gap between "Hard Math" and "Client Profit".*

* [ ] **Post 1: The Geometry of Reasoning**
* **Topic:** Using Persistent Homology (TDA) to verify agentic traces.
* **Reframe:** Explain how this identifies "Logical Redundancy" to cut token costs by 30%.


* [ ] **Post 2: Stochastic Stability in Agentic Loops**
* **Topic:** Solving the Path Integral for LLM state transitions.
* **Reframe:** "How I calculate the exact risk of an autonomous agent failing in production before it happens."


* [ ] **Post 3: The 1-Wasserstein Budget**
* **Topic:** Optimal Transport theory applied to token decoding.
* **Reframe:** "Faster Inference via SHAPE: Moving beyond token-by-token limitations for 5x speedups."


* [ ] **Post 4: Type-Safe Sovereignty with PydanticAI**
* **Topic:** Dependency injection and strict schema enforcement in multi-agent systems.
* **Reframe:** "Why 'Vibe Coding' fails at scale and how type-safety protects your AI investment."


* [ ] **Post 5: The ROI of Thinking Time**
* **Topic:** Scaling test-time compute (o1/DeepThink models).
* **Reframe:** "Calculating the Pareto Frontier: When to spend $1.00 on reasoning to save $1,000 in operational errors."



## Phase 3: Monetization UI (The Consultant Interface)

* [ ] **Create /Services Page:**
* **Tier 1: The Blueprint ($2,500):** A 1-week technical audit and DAG architecture design.
* **Tier 2: The Architect-in-Residence ($9,000+/mo):** Production hardening, LangGraph orchestration, and team enablement.


* [ ] **Replace "About" with "Sovereignty":** Focus on your UBA background as a "Guardian of Reasoning" who prevents "Agentic Gridlock."
* [ ] **Add "Book a Strategy Session" CTA:** Use a dark-themed Calendly embed.

## Phase 4: Distribution & Authority

* [ ] **Sync with AlphaSignal/Latent Space:** Submit your "TDA for Reasoning" post to high-density newsletters to attract CTOs.
* [ ] **LinkedIn Refactor:** Headline: "AI Architect | Applied Math (UBA) | Building Verifiable Reasoning Loops that Scale ROI."
