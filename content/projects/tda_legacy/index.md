An architectural intelligence engine that utilizes Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to map and disentangle massive legacy monoliths.

### Core Methodology
This tool addresses the complexity of a **2GB legacy monolithic codebase** by treating code dependencies as a high-dimensional point cloud. By applying **Graph Theory** and **TDA**, the engine identifies critical modularization boundaries and hidden bottlenecks that traditional static analysis tools miss.

### Impact & Performance
* **Migration Velocity:** Achieved a **10x increase** in migration speed through automated boundary detection.
* **Architectural Mapping:** Developed a TDA-based engine to visualize complex code dependencies across thousands of files.
* **Stack:** Python, **.NET (Roslyn API)**, and advanced Graph Theory algorithms.
