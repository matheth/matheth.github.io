A robust multi-agent orchestration system designed to automate self-healing documentation pipelines across distributed repository ecosystems.

### Strategic Overview
Using **LangGraph** and **PydanticAI**, I engineered a fleet of autonomous agents that monitor and update technical documentation in real-time. This system ensures that documentation remains synchronized with code changes across **200+ repositories** without manual intervention.

### Technical Implementation
* **Agentic Orchestration:** Built using state-of-the-art multi-agent frameworks to handle complex, non-linear engineering workflows.
* **Semantic Search:** Implemented semantic indexing to improve developer onboarding speed by **10x**.
* **Stack:** **LangGraph**, **PydanticAI**, Vertex AI, and Docker for scalable deployment.
